# DungeonCreator

My goal with this project is to get a better understanding on dungeon creation algorithms. <br/>
I will mostly be trying out different approaches on how to generate dungeons with different algorithms and how to layer and combine algorithms for better effects.

## Current Algorithms
 - Binary Space Partitioning
 
## Planned Algorithm Additions
 - Cellular Automata
 - Height Map

## Demonstrations

Binary Space Partitioning
