# DungeonCreator

** This project is still a work-in-progress. ** <br/>

My goal with this project is to get a better understanding on dungeon creation algorithms.
I'm currently working on implementing a binary space partitioning algorithm to create diverse and interesting dungeons.
It's developed as a Unity Project for easier visualization.
